# Set up a decent development environment and make `zsh` shine

This repository contains configuration for `zsh` (aka "dotfiles") and an
installation/update script to make your macOS `zsh` environment fly.

## Installation

Just run `zsh setup.sh` in this directory. It will interactively walk you
through the steps of installing everything you need for a decent development
environment that looks awesome.

This script tries to detect what you have installed and won't overwrite anything
by default.

Command line options:
```text
NAME
    ./setup.sh - Install an amazing development and terminal environment for zsh

SYNOPSYS
    ./setup.sh -h
    ./setup.sh -i [-n] [-y] [-f]

DESCRIPTION
    This script installs a great user experience for zsh and will install
    a range of useful development tools

OPTIONS
    The following options are available:

    -h  show this help and exit.

    -i  Run the installation process.

    -n  dry run: Show what would be installed but don't do anything.

    -y  Answer yes to all questions. This makes the script non-interactive.

    -f  Force installation â€” don't check if tools are already installed.

EXAMPLES
    ./setup.sh -infy  Run through everything, show what would be installed without installing anything.
```

## What's included

The script makes sure that almost all of the tools you would likely want to use
as a developer are installed and configured. You can safely run this script
multiple times; it will skip things that already appear to be installed.

### An amazing terminal experience

This script will install the following:

* [XCode Command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - The missing package manager for macOS
* [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - fancy fast prompt
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Fish-like syntax highlighting for Zsh
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/) - Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh
* [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) - make `ls` look pretty
* [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - terminal fonts with icons for PowerLevel10k and colorls

It will also install this repository's `dotfiles/dot-zshrc` into `$HOME/.zshrc`,
which uses all of the magic above to make your terminal experience awesome.
