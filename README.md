# Gert's dotfiles

This repository contains configuration for `zsh` (aka "dotfiles") and an
installation/update script to set up a macOS or Linux `zsh`.

It installs a nice looking powerlevel10k prompt, a bunch of useful tools, and
sets up the `PATH` and other environment variables.

**NOTE**: This is really only for my personal use; it's not tested on any other
systems besides my own (macOS Intel, macOS M1, and Ubuntu on WSL), and even then
things might be broken.

Also, I might change things recklessly and break stuff that is currently working, so
use at your own peril. ðŸ˜‡

This repository exists as a public repo just in case anyone finds this useful.

## Installation

Just run `zsh setup.sh` in this directory. It will interactively walk you
through the steps of installing everything you need for a decent development
environment that looks awesome.

This script tries to detect what you have installed and won't overwrite anything
by default.

Command line options:

```text
NAME
    ./setup.sh - Install an amazing development and terminal environment for zsh

SYNOPSYS
    ./setup.sh -h
    ./setup.sh -i [-n] [-y] [-f]

DESCRIPTION
    This script installs a great user experience for zsh and will install
    a range of useful development tools

OPTIONS
    The following options are available:

    -h  show this help and exit.

    -i  Run the installation process.

    -n  dry run: Show what would be installed but don't do anything.

    -y  Answer yes to all questions. This makes the script non-interactive.

    -f  Force installation â€” don't check if tools are already installed.

EXAMPLES
    ./setup.sh -infy  Run through everything, show what would be installed without installing anything.
```

## What's included

The script makes sure that almost all of the tools you may want to use
as a developer are installed and configured. It will skip things that
already appear to be installed.

### An amazing terminal experience

This script will install the following:

- [XCode Command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - The missing package manager for macOS
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - fancy fast prompt
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Fish-like syntax highlighting for Zsh (only works on macOS currently)

It will also install this repository's `dotfiles/dot-zshrc` into `$HOME/.zshrc`,
which uses all of the magic above to make your terminal experience awesome.

Optionally, you might want to look at installing the following yourself:

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/) - Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh
- [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) - make `ls` look pretty
- [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - terminal fonts with icons for PowerLevel10k and colorls
